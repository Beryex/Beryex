## Research Experience

### Dynamic Learning Model Architecture in Deep Learning Processes, UIUC
- **Role:** Independent Project Leader
- **Expected May 2024**
- Developed an approach to dynamically change the neural network architecture, including the number of convolutional kernels and activation functions during the training process, to generate random model architectures
- Analyzed the adjusted model's output accuracy, stability of performance, as well as the model's spatial and temporal complexity, to further optimize the model architecture for improved overall performance
- Implemented the dynamic adjustment mechanism using Python within the PyTorch framework, integrating the method into models used in academic papers to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach


### SoccerNet Image Recognition Competition, ZJU-UIUC Institute
- **Role:** Main Member of the Action Recognition Group
- **Period:** Feb 2023 – May 2023
- Used time-series analysis methods to identify and precisely label key actions of multiple players in continuous frames of provided football match videos, including specific movements of the players and their exact locations on the field
- Reviewed and tested code written by team members to ensure code quality and efficiency; responsible for code optimization to enhance program performance and stability


### Graph Retrieval Based on Scene Graph Matching, ZJU
- **Role:** Main Member
- **Period:** June 2022 – July 2022
- Employed convolutional neural network (CNN) technology to analyze input images, identified key features within the images, and determined the scenes depicted in the images; used these key features to search for images with similar scenes from the database, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval
- Collected and reviewed over 10 related papers, replicating some of the deep learning models presented in these papers; compared the Top-1 and Top-5 error rates with those of the models from the papers to evaluate and optimize the methods described in this thesis
